# Changelog

## 0.23.2 (2026-05-05)

### Changed
- Release build signing now falls back to debug signing when `KEY_ANDROID` is not present, so maintainers can still produce a release artifact locally without exposing private signing credentials.

### Fixed
- Prevented DHU disconnect teardown from forcing the phone back to launcher/home when AADisplay session closes on the virtual-display home screen.
- Teardown package-stop logic now excludes:
  - AADisplay itself
  - configured launch/home package
  - current foreground package on the primary phone display

### Verification
- Reproduced issue with config where `LauncherPackage` and `HomePackage` were both launcher-based, then validated corrected behavior after patch.
- `:aa-display:assembleDebug` succeeds with this change.
- Installed and prepared for live device retest flow.

## 0.23.1 (2026-05-04)

### Added
- In-app GitHub menu now points to the production fork: `https://github.com/Stashboy/AADisplay`.

### Changed
- Internal AADisplay behavior now syncs `HomePackage` to `LauncherPackage` so task-view home behavior is consistent with selected launch package.
- Sidebar Back key handling now uses Android virtual-display key event semantics (`FLAG_FROM_SYSTEM | FLAG_VIRTUAL_HARD_KEY`) for more reliable back navigation.

### Fixed
- Sidebar Back now works reliably in task-view sessions.
- Backing out to AADisplay home now clears pinned PiP state using the same cleanup strategy as Home (with front-home checks).

### Cleanup / Optimization (Evidence-Based)
- Fixed a real API-compatibility risk in `AADisplayConfig`: replaced Java Stream `.toList()` usage (API 34+) with Kotlin collection operators (safe for min SDK 31).
- Added missing `super.onDestroy()` in `AaControlService` to resolve lifecycle correctness lint error.
- Removed unused settings warning view/resources and unused string bloat in main settings screen.
- Internationalization cleanup for top-right menu title (`GitHub` moved to string resource).

### Verification
- `:aa-display:assembleDebug` succeeds after all changes.
- `:aa-display:lintDebug` re-run confirms resolved issues for:
  - `MissingSuperCall` (AaControlService)
  - `NewApi` (AADisplayConfig stream/toList path)
  - `HardcodedText` (`menu_main.xml` GitHub title)
- Runtime verification completed against Android Auto `16.6` behavior in both DHU and real head unit sessions.

## 0.23.0 (2026-05-04)

### Added
- Dynamic TaskView sizing lock to stabilize UI rendering across different head unit dimensions.
- Better teardown behavior for TaskView sessions to reduce lingering app states on disconnect/exit.
- Android Auto 16.6 hook compatibility updates.

### Changed
- Simplified settings UI to a single screen with only production-relevant options:
  - Auto Open
  - Default Launch Package
  - Delay Destroy Time
- Default GitHub menu flow retained from the main screen (settings gear flow removed).
- Production version string updated to `0.23#16.6-r1`.

### Fixed
- Kernel panic scenario during specific TaskView lifecycle transitions.
- Home/exit transition handling that previously left abnormal PiP-like states.
- Inconsistent YouTube rendering outcomes caused by unstable virtual display dimensions.

### Security / Privacy
- Removed repository-tracked signing key material from source control.
- Added keystore patterns to `.gitignore`.
- Removed machine-specific Gradle JDK path from tracked config.

### Compatibility
- Validated behavior against Android Auto 16.6 and device-side testing with real head unit workflow.
